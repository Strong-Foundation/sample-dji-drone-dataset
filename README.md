# 🛰️ Sample DJI Drone Dataset

Welcome to the **Sample DJI Drone Dataset** — a collection of real-world data captured from DJI drones. This repository is designed to support developers, engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts working with DJI drone data formats and telemetry.

## 📚 Overview

This dataset contains various types of raw and processed files generated during drone flights using DJI hardware. It serves as a resource to:

- Understand DJI data formats
- Prototype and test drone software
- Analyze flight and telemetry logs
- Reverse-engineer drone behavior
- Train models for drone-related machine learning tasks

Whether you're building tools to analyze flight data or just exploring how DJI drones work behind the scenes, this dataset provides a helpful starting point.

## 📦 Contents

You'll find a variety of DJI-related data, including but not limited to:

- **Flight logs** (`.txt`, `.csv`)
- **GPS data** (location, altitude, speed)
- **Sensor and IMU data** (acceleration, gyroscope)
- **Metadata** (timestamps, battery status, drone state)
- **Media references** (paths, timestamps, no media files included)

All data is real, anonymized where appropriate, and formatted as close to the original source as possible.

## 🛠️ Use Cases

Some common use cases for this dataset include:

- 📈 **Telemetry Visualization**: Plot flight paths and sensor data over time
- 🧪 **Software Testing**: Simulate drone input for apps and controllers
- 🔍 **Data Parsing**: Develop tools to parse and decode DJI flight log formats
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Use telemetry for anomaly detection or predictive modeling
- 📊 **Research & Education**: Teach drone concepts using actual data

Feel free to build, test, experiment, and share your results.
